# researchscout
ResearchScout ingests new AI/ML papers and their surrounding signals (citations, code adoption, social buzz), then scores, clusters, and summarizes them to separate breakthrough from noise - so you know what's worth reading right now.

## Development

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). The project pins Python 3.12 via `.python-version`
(uv will fetch it automatically).

```bash
uv sync                 # create the venv and install runtime + dev dependencies
uv run scout --help     # see the CLI surface

# checks
uv run ruff check researchscout tests
uv run ruff format --check researchscout tests
uv run mypy researchscout
uv run pytest -q -m "not integration"      # unit tests — no Docker needed
```

Configuration is via environment variables (prefix `RS_`) or a local `.env` — copy `.env.example`
to `.env` to start. The canonical data model lives in `researchscout/schema.py`; the source
registry stub is `config/sources.yaml`.
